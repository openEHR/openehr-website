It enables GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists, NGOs, specialists and hospital-based clinicians to see what is going on with their most complex mental health clients as they move across the continuum of care.  Ocean Mental Health provides the ability to create a stepped model of care for mental health clients - assisting people to get the care they need in the most efficient way and enabling care-givers to access a clear and accurate picture of the needs and status of the person at any given time.</p>
